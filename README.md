# Griff-s-AwesomeGameDev-stuff
Repo comprised of multiple game dev related tools with a brief description of each.
Each software, engine, or tool listed here I have independently researched and have some degree of interest in using in the future.
----------------------------------------------------------
1: Blender Game Engine (UPBGE)
- Open source, free 3d game engine forked off of Blender and uses many of the capabilities of Blender in game design.  It integrates many design functions of blender, including modeling, rendering, animating, 2D artwork, audio work, and many other useful feature to help program your games, such as scripting via the built-in python API, logic bricks, and graphics rendering.  The main downside is that it can be heavy on some systems, partially due to the how it uses python commands which aren't as fast or powerful as other languages.  Link: https://upbge.org/#/


2: Godot
- Free to use, open source game engine.  Can create 2d and 3d.  Uses scene-driven design, can construct games from blocks.  Link: https://godotengine.org/


3: RPG Maker
- A series of engines designed to create simple top-down RPG games.  Very simple tool that many can use without issue, complete with a map editor, an event designer, character creators, and other features.  It isn't as complex as other engines, but it's still somewhat powerful and can create amazing games in the right hands. Link: https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/

4: Game Maker
- A series of engines primarily desgined to creat 2D games.  Easy to pick up for beginners and provides a wide array of tools, primarily coded in it's own language (GML).  Link: https://gamemaker.io/en

5: Source 2
- A 3D game engine by Valve, designed as the successor to Source 1.  Written in C++, the engine is capable of rendering highly detailed scenes with minimal framerate drops, and sports a unique (and iconic) physics system, as well as it's own sound system and multiple other features.

6: Unity
- A widely used game engine for 2D and 3D games alike that uses both C# and C++.  This engine has a ton of capabilities, from AI-based asset creation tools, animation and audio editting and creation, various lighting designs, multiplayer and VR support, scripting, UI, and interfacing, Unity can make almost anything.

7: Visual Studio
- This is not strictly a game design tool, but I still think it's helpful for potential game programmers.  VS is an integrated programming software by Microsoft, using mostly C++ and C#, as well as Java, CSS, and HTML.  This is a key software for prospective programmers to learn the ropes of certain languages, allowing you to familiarize yourself with how to build and run successful algorithms, a process key in developing games.

8: Trello
- Trello is an application deigned to help you organize and manage your projects.  You can create boards with all your planned implementaions laid out in an organized to-do list, as well as attaching other potential features to add to your game, the person I interviewed actually uses Trello to manage his work.

9: Krita
- Krita is a free art program that is very similar to Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint, in that it provides all the necessary tools needed to create digital art.  When designing detailed assets for games, this software is extremely useful as it provides much more freedom and tools to create whatever design you want for your game.  It also includes an animation function and many stylized brushes.  Link: https://krita.org/en/

10: Spine
- Spine is a software dedicated to creating 2D sprite animation for games.  It's a really simple animation tool that doesnt require extensive knowledge in art to take advantage of.  It uses a skeleton-based animation model that animates sprite movements through "bones", basically moving sprites without frame by frame animation.  It includes tons of features to make these animations pop, like textures, preview modes, wights, meshes, and more. Link: https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-in-depth#Features
