# Griff-s-AwesomeGameDev-stuff
Repo comprised of multiple game dev related tools with a brief description of each.
Each software, engine, or tool listed here I have independently researched and have some degree of interest in using in the future.
----------------------------------------------------------
1: Blender Game Engine (UPBGE)
- Open source, free 3d game engine forked off of Blender and uses many of the capabilities of Blender in game design.  It integrates many design functions of blender, including modeling, rendering, animating, 2D artwork, audio work, and many other useful feature to help program your games, such as scripting via the built-in python API, logic bricks, and graphics rendering.  The main downside is that it can be heavy on some systems, partially due to the how it uses python commands which aren't as fast or powerful as other languages.


2: Godot
- Free to use, open source game engine.  Can create 2d and 3d.  Uses scene-driven design, can construct games from blocks.


3: RPG Maker
